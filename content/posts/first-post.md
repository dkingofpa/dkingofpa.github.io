Welcome to the first post on my new site. I'm using the Hugo static site generator to build out the site.
Looking forward to playing around with a site that I'm hoping to be more active than just a static vanity
site.

I choose Hugo because one of my interests is to learn more about the Go language. In my past and present I've worked
with a few CMS products including Drupal, WordPress, and Adobe Experience Manager. I definitely didn't want something
so heavy for my own site. I'm more of a minimalist in my own projects so a static site generator is perfect for me
and having a default theme allows me to start playing around right away.

As I poke around and try a few things out I realize that I'm going to need to make some changes to the theme. ;)
